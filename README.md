# Note:
This is the Github repository for the Plantsol AI model-related files. The backend.py files contains the server code through which the mobile app can interact with the EfficientNet AI model and get global agricultural news summaries. The MobileNet model is slightly less accurate, but also lighter/faster, so it is used directly on the user's phone in the case of limited connectivity (useful for farmers in areas with weak Internet).

**Github notified me that my EfficientNet files were too large to upload to this repository, so I have moved them to the following Google Drive links:**
- Efficient_Net.keras: (https://drive.google.com/file/d/15oK4hsMc2ljeTeshlP9JWT0_n-gl2YXZ/view?usp=sharing)
- Efficient_Net.h5: (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1avLdBEtxY1zFPmJGjFQhux2WkYoaxIxp/view?usp=sharing)

Thank you!

Best regards,
